FUTURE (v1.5+) TODO
=============================

- Hooks for minification/formatting
- TypeScript/TSX support via transformers

TS/TSX TRANSPILATION MODES
--------------------------

MODE 1: SIMPLE TRANSPILATION (NO SOURCEMAP)
----------------------------------------------
- HTML contains: lang="ts" with TS source in textContent
- On load: transpile TS → JS, cache JS in IndexedDB
- Runtime: use cached JS (fast)
- On export: write original TS back to HTML
- Next load: transpile again (but use cache if available)

Key: TS is source-of-truth in HTML, JS is derived cache


MODE 2: SELF-CONTAINED (WITH SOURCEMAP)
------------------------------------------
- HTML contains: lang="ts" sourcemap="inline" with JS+sourcemap in textContent
- On load: parse existing JS, no transpilation needed
- Runtime: use the JS directly (fastest)
- Can extract TS from sourcemap anytime
- On export: can write JS+sourcemap OR extract and write TS
- Next load: no transpilation needed at all

Key: JS+sourcemap is source-of-truth in HTML


MODE 3: UPGRADE PATH (GENERATE SOURCEMAP)
--------------------------------------------
- Start with Option 1 (TS in HTML, JS cached)
- Call something like convertToSourcemapMode()
- Re-transpile with sourcemap enabled
- Update HTML to contain JS+sourcemap instead of TS
- Now in Option 2

Key: Transition from "TS in HTML" to "JS+sourcemap in HTML"
