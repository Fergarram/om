## Stormborn Engine

The engine I'm working with is one I made:

```typescript
@@@STORMBORNSOURCE@@@
```

## Code style

Use snake case and a functional/declarative code style. Avoid object oriented programming.

Only work on requested features. You can suggest improvements or features but don't implement them without permission.

## How to respond

When asked for changes in code, provide only parts of the code that need to be changed and make it easy to copy-paste. For example, if only the obj_player step function changed, just return that function.
